# 🗳️ Indian General Elections 2024 - Power BI Dashboard

This repository showcases my first end-to-end **Power BI project**, built to analyze and visualize the results and trends from the **2024 Indian General Elections**—the world's largest democratic exercise. The goal was to turn complex public election data into an interactive and informative visual experience.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is designed to explore key dimensions of the election—from national-level insights to constituency-specific data—through a suite of interactive dashboards.

### 📊 Dashboard Modules

1. **Overall Analysis**
   - National vote share by political parties
   - Total voter turnout and top-level performance metrics

2. **State Demographics**
   - Voter segmentation by age, gender, and population distribution
   - State-wise voter characteristics

3. **Constituency Analysis**
   - Party-wise and candidate-wise performance in each constituency
   - Margins of victory and vote distribution

4. **State Analysis**
   - Comparative view of vote shares, performance, and turnout across states
   - Key highlights from top/bottom performing regions

## 🔍 Data Analysis Approach

To prepare and process the data for meaningful visualization:

- 🧮 **Microsoft Excel** was used for:
  - Initial data cleaning and structuring
  - Handling raw data from public sources in `.csv` formats
  - Identifying missing values, duplicates, and formatting inconsistencies

- 🧾 **SQL** (MySQL) was used for:
  - Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Joining multiple tables and extracting relational insights
  - Creating meaningful aggregates and summaries

- 📊 **Power BI** was used to:
  - Model the cleaned and structured dataset
  - Build relationships between key entities (state, constituency, party, candidate)
  - Create calculated columns and measures using **DAX**
  - Design four interactive dashboards with filters, slicers, and drilldowns

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- To derive data-driven insights from publicly available electoral data  
- To strengthen data wrangling, modeling, and visualization skills  
- To develop an end-to-end BI pipeline, from raw data to insights  
- To understand how relationships in datasets affect analysis depth and accuracy
